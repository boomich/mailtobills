## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run everything via Turborepo:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

You can also run app-specific scripts inside each package if needed.

---

## UI components (shadcn/ui)

This repo uses **shadcn/ui** in a monorepo setup.

### Adding components

Run from the repo root and target the dashboard app:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button -c apps/dashboard
```

Components are generated into:

```
packages/ui/src/components
```

### Using components

Import shared components from the UI package:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@mailtobills/ui/components/button";
```

Tailwind is already configured to work across apps and the shared UI package.

---

## Auth env (OAuth / Convex)

For `@convex-dev/auth` OAuth redirects, the Convex backend must know the dashboard base URL.

Set one of the following env vars to the dashboard origin:

```
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

or

```
CONVEX_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

Adjust for preview/production environments accordingly.
